    <h2>Regex as Ritual</h2>
    <p>Each pattern is a promise. Whether validating a title-cased product name or a ₹1 discount code, regex becomes a quiet guardian of intent.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>^[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s[A-Z][a-z]+)*$</code> – Ensures product names begin with honour and consistency.</li>
      <li><code>^OFFER-\d{3}[A-Z]{2}$</code> – A structure that affirms clarity in promotional codes.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="boolean">
    <h2>Boolean Logic as Affirmation</h2>
    <p>Instead of asking “Is this false?”, we ask “Can this be true?”—a subtle shift that turns validation into validation of presence. Your <code>isValid()</code> method isn’t just a check; it’s a quiet yes.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="exceptions">
    <h2>Exception Handling as Emotional Resilience</h2>
    <p>Try. Catch. Heal. In code and in life, we anticipate failure not to punish, but to recover gracefully. A <code>try-catch</code> block is a metaphor for care: we don’t crash, we cradle.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="teaching">
    <h2>Teaching Modules as Gifts</h2>
    <p>Each OneNote section, each scaffolded validator, is a lantern for future learners. We archive not to preserve perfection, but to offer clarity and companionship across time.</p>
